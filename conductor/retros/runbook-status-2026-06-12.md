## 1. Status snapshot (as of 2026-06-05 PM2)

### Recently shipped (last 10 commits)

- **`HEAD`** (pending — 2026-06-05 PM2) — **Dev-up full-stack
  composition.** Three new artifacts so a contributor can clone-and-run:
  - `docker-compose.dev.yml` — SurrealDB + WebAPI + Frontend with
    healthcheck-gated dependency order. WebAPI container's
    `docker-entrypoint.sh` waits for SurrealDB to be reachable then runs
    `oasis-surreal up` (apply every committed schema + every Migrations/
    file) before launching the host. Schema CLI is now shipped in the
    same image alongside `OASIS.WebAPI.dll`.
  - `dev-up.sh` + `dev-up.ps1` — root-level orchestrators that
    auto-detect docker compose v2, docker-compose v1, podman-compose, or
    `podman compose` and bring the stack up. `--logs` tails combined
    output; `--rebuild` rebuilds images; `--clean` wipes the
    surrealdb_data volume.
  - `dev-down.sh` + `dev-down.ps1` — teardown helpers with
    `--wipe` / `-Wipe` to drop the volume.

  Companion: `appsettings.Development.json` gets a full `SurrealDb` block
  (`Endpoint`, `Namespace`, `Database`, `User`, `Password`) targeting
  `http://127.0.0.1:8000` for host-direct dev runs that talk to a
  locally-running SurrealDB instance.

  **Two pre-existing bugs surfaced + fixed during the verification**:
  - `McpToolRegistry` was Singleton consuming Scoped `IMcpTool`
    implementations — invalid captive dependency that crashed
    `BuildServiceProvider` whenever `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development`.
    Now Scoped (the registry is a 5-entry Dictionary so per-request
    rebuild is free).
  - The boot-time SurrealDB reachability probe used `SELECT 1 AS ok`
    which is invalid SurrealQL (SELECT requires FROM in 1.5+). Switched
    to `RETURN 1` — the SurrealDB-idiomatic no-op.

  End-to-end verified: host-run WebAPI boots against the local SurrealDB
  at `127.0.0.1:8000`, `/health` returns 200 with `storage-db: Healthy`,
  swagger.json serves at /swagger/v1/swagger.json.
- **`HEAD-1`** (2026-06-05 PM) — **Migration `up` CLI + live integration
  test.** New `oasis-surreal up` subcommand applies `Generated/Schemas/`
  then `Migrations/` (lexical order in each, both funnel through the
  `schema_migration` ledger). The runner now bootstraps the configured
  namespace + database on first apply (`DEFINE NAMESPACE IF NOT EXISTS` +
  `DEFINE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS`) so a fresh SurrealDB server needs no
  out-of-band setup. New `MigrationRunnerLiveTests` integration test (in
  `Oasis.SurrealDb.Schema.Tests`, tagged `Category=Live`) applies all 26
  schemas to a live SurrealDB at `localhost:8000` then re-runs to prove
  idempotency. The live test caught **5 real SurrealDB syntax errors in
  the emitter** that the byte-equivalence tests missed:
  - regex operator `=~` is not valid SurrealQL — switched to
    `string::matches($value, "...")`
  - `FLEXIBLE` modifier goes AFTER `TYPE` not before
  - `FLEXIBLE` requires `object` or `array<object>` (bare `array` fails)
  - bootstrap `schema_migration` DDL needed `IF NOT EXISTS`
  - SurrealDB 2.x rejects `UPDATE x:y` on a missing record — switched to
    `UPSERT x:y` which auto-creates
  All five fixes shipped in this session. End-to-end CLI verified against
  the local instance: 26 schemas APPLIED on first run, 26 SKIP on second
  run (clean idempotent no-op). New `Migrations/README.md` documents the
  data-migration naming convention + authoring rules.
- **`HEAD-1`** (2026-06-05 AM) — **Schema graph + closed-set enums.**
  Every FK column on the 17 POCOs now carries `[References(typeof(Target))]`
  (~30 fields touched). The `.surql` emit flips from `string` to
  `record<target>` (or `option<record<target>>`). The RELATE-edge POCOs
  (`ForkedFrom`, `Executes`) emit as native
  `DEFINE TABLE x TYPE RELATION FROM y TO z`. Closed-set enums emit a
  `DEFINE PARAM IF NOT EXISTS $<table>_<column>` block at the top of the
  file, with `ASSERT $value INSIDE $<table>_<column>` on the field.
  Per-slice flowcharts now render outbound edges (cross-slice targets
  appear as dashed-blue ghost nodes); the master flowchart adds a full
  enum legend listing every closed set with its C# enum type name.
  **Known follow-up**: store adapters under `Providers/Stores/Surreal/`
  still write the bare-hex wire format and need to switch to the
  `"table:hex"` prefixed form before integration tests against a live
  SurrealDB will pass. Unit suite: 567/567 green.
- **`HEAD-1`** (2026-06-03) — **C#-first SurrealDB authoring lands
  end-to-end.** 24 attributed POCOs in `Persistence/SurrealDb/Models/`
  replace the entire Mermaid → POCO source-gen path. New
  `OasisSurrealDbOptions` (Connection + Generation sections) consolidates
  connection + generator-output configuration. Schema/flowchart/DBML
  artifacts emit to `Persistence/SurrealDb/Generated/`. `MermaidParser`,
  `MermaidSchemaModel`, `MermaidParseException`, `AggregateEmitter`, the
  entire `Oasis.SurrealDb.SourceGen` package, and the 24 `.mermaid` source
  files are deleted. Byte-equivalence test
  (`AttributePocoByteEquivalenceTests`) discovers every
  `[SurrealTable]`-decorated POCO at runtime and asserts byte-identical
  `.surql` emit. See §3 (rewritten) for the new convention; CONVENTION.md
  + ANNOTATIONS.md likewise rewritten.
- **`HEAD-1`** (2026-05-27) — Phase C design pivoted to C#-first (this is
  the commit `HEAD` above implements).
- **`2326714`** — Initial design doc landed proposing the
  Mermaid-portfolio model (multi-diagram authoring). Superseded same-day
  by the C#-first pivot above; commit preserved in history for the pivot
  reasoning.
- **`d4b546d`** — `surrealql-toolkit` umbrella ADR + 5 constituent pending
  tracks. **Stale as of evening 2026-05-27** — the public-toolkit framing
  is no longer in scope. Clean-up decision deferred to next session.
- **`137992c`** — RUNBOOK §4 Phase B shipped (since retired on
  2026-06-03). Aggregate slice emitter + 24 source `.mermaid` files + 6
  slice diagrams under `docs/aggregates/` + master at
  `docs/domain.generated.mermaid`. Replaced by the C#-first flowchart
  emitter; outputs now land at
  `Persistence/SurrealDb/Generated/Flowcharts/` in the `graph LR` shape.
- **`9bcfd32`** + **`b66a09f`** — RUNBOOK §4 refined to make slice files a
  generated artifact (not hand-authored); §5 sequencing + §6 phase table
  updated. Both also superseded by the C#-first pivot.
- **`295d67c`** — `mcp-surface` track closed. Read-only MCP server at
  `/mcp` (ModelContextProtocol.AspNetCore 1.3.0) behind JWT+ApiKey
  multi-scheme. 5 tools (quest reachability, holon traversal, NFT graph,
  avatar-scoped read, HNSW vector search). +5 unit tests (540/540 green),
  13 integration tests gated on E1. Write tools deferred; runtime evidence
  + F9–F12 latent-item review pending E1 image fix.
- **`24a7403`** — `surrealdb-migration` Phase D (wave-2 commit). 3
  SurrealQuest stores (1595 LOC) + 6 `.surql` schemas
  (150/160/170/190/200/230) + 28 integration tests. G2 single-winner
  claim primitive + fork write-pairing via BEGIN/COMMIT. DI flipped at
  Program.cs:267-298. Task 9 closed.
- **`8f1eee1`** — RUNBOOK.md + tracks.md consolidation.
- **`d318bcb`** — `CONVENTION.md` partial-class extension pattern.
- **`92ede75`** — 8 source-gen'd POCOs for quest + dapp-composition;
  dapp-composition slice end-to-end.

### Working tree (as of snapshot)

Clean — only `conductor/.conductor_session_log` modified (auto-generated,
ignored in commits). Nothing else in flight.

### Active phase (as of snapshot)

**Phase C — redesigned again, now C#-first.** Two design iterations landed
in this session before settling. The Mermaid-portfolio direction
(multi-diagram authoring across `schema/*.mermaid`) was the right
*response* to the original Phase C scope but solved the wrong layer. The
user steer that resolved it: ".NET-first, OASIS-internal, no
public-toolkit framing, source of truth = decorated C# POCOs."

Short version: schema source = **decorated C# POCOs in this repo**.
Attributes declare shape (FK, indexes, ASSERT inputs, state-machine
binding); partial classes carry validation + domain helpers. The existing
Roslyn source-gen is **inverted** — instead of `.mermaid` → POCO, it scans
the C# attribute surface and emits `.surql` + a single DBML manifest
(`docs/schema.dbml`) + state-machine code + a guardrail traceability
runbook. See
`conductor/tracks/surrealql-toolkit/DESIGN-mermaid-portfolio.md` (filename
retained for git history; contents now describe the C#-first model).

The pivot is OASIS-internal in scope. The `surrealql-toolkit` umbrella + 4
sibling tracks (drift, db-pull, studio, packaging) are stale-but-in-tree
pending a clean-up decision next session; the `data-backfill-migrations`
track stays valid (F6 still has to happen).

**This session is design-only.** No code, no file moves. Next session
begins with the prototype slice (`wallet_nft`, 3 entities) to prove
byte-equivalent `.surql` output before mechanically migrating the rest.

### Pending decisions (as of snapshot)

- **Phase C trigger** — generator multi-table parsing + FK emission lands
  after Phase B is validated (see §4.3 below). Recommended order: Phase B →
  Phase C → Phase E (Quest cutover) so the generator settles on the new
  authoring layout before the Quest aggregate moves to source-gen'd POCOs.
- ~~**Environment E1 unblocker**~~ — **RESOLVED 2026-06-12.** Swapped the
  start URI to `rocksdb:///data/db` in `docker-compose.dev.yml` +
  `podman-compose.yml` (note: `podman-compose.yml` was deleted 2026-06-12).
  The 1.5.4 slim image lacks `surrealkv`; RocksDB syncs its WAL per commit
  so G1 durability is preserved. A 2.x/3.x bump (which restores `surrealkv`
  default-on) is tracked as a separate workstream: `surrealdb-major-upgrade`.

---

## 4. Mermaid visualization restructure (shipped — C#-first pivot)

**What shipped:** the visualization restructure completed via the C#-first
pivot (2026-06-03). The old Mermaid-source pipeline (`source/*.mermaid` →
Roslyn source-gen → POCOs) was inverted: the 24 hand-authored `.mermaid`
source files and the `Oasis.SurrealDb.SourceGen` package were deleted, and
the schema source of truth became decorated C# POCOs in
`Persistence/SurrealDb/Models/`.

Flowchart generation now runs the other way — the `AttributeSchemaScanner`
in `Oasis.SurrealDb.Schema` reads the POCO attribute surface and emits
`graph LR` diagrams via `MermaidFlowchartEmitter`. The as-built outputs
live at:

- `Persistence/SurrealDb/Generated/Flowcharts/` — per-slice
  `.flowchart.mermaid` files + `domain.flowchart.mermaid` master
- `Persistence/SurrealDb/Generated/Schemas/` — the `.surql` DDL files
  emitted from the same scan
- `Persistence/SurrealDb/Generated/Dbml/` — `schema.dbml` (opt-in via
  `OasisSurrealDbOptions.Generation.EmitDbml`)

### 4.1 Slice membership (as generated)

| Slice | Entities |
|---|---|
| `quest` | quest, quest_node, quest_edge, quest_dependency, quest_run, quest_node_execution |
| `quest_templates` | quest_template, quest_node_template |
| `dapp_composition` | dapp_series, dapp_series_quest |
| `bridge` | bridge_tx, saga_steps, consumed_vaa_ledger, idempotency_key_store, operation_log |
| `wallet_nft` | wallet, nft_ownership, swap_state |
| `identity` | avatar, api_key, holon, star_odk |

Cross-slice references (e.g. `dapp_series_quest.quest_id` → `quest`) appear
as dashed-blue ghost nodes in per-slice flowcharts and as full edges in the
master diagram.

### 4.2 Regenerating the flowcharts and schemas

```
oasis-surreal generate-from-assembly bin/Debug/net8.0/OASIS.WebAPI.dll
oasis-surreal flowcharts-from-assembly bin/Debug/net8.0/OASIS.WebAPI.dll
```

The first command scans every `[SurrealTable]`-decorated POCO, reruns
`AttributeSchemaScanner` + `SurqlEmitter`, and overwrites the `.surql` files
in `Generated/Schemas/`. The second command reruns `MermaidFlowchartEmitter`
and overwrites the flowchart files in `Generated/Flowcharts/`. Both must be
run after any POCO attribute change. The `AttributePocoByteEquivalenceTests`
suite catches schema drift in CI without needing a live database.

### 4.3 Emitter source locations

| Emitter | File |
|---|---|
| Schema scanner | `packages/Oasis.SurrealDb.Schema/Generator/AttributeSchemaScanner.cs` |
| `.surql` emitter | `packages/Oasis.SurrealDb.Schema/Generator/SurqlEmitter.cs` |
| Flowchart emitter | `packages/Oasis.SurrealDb.Schema/Generator/MermaidFlowchartEmitter.cs` |
| CLI entry point | `packages/Oasis.SurrealDb.Schema/Program.cs` (`generate-from-assembly` subcommand) |

### 4.4 Historical note

Phases B and C as originally drafted (slice annotations on `.mermaid` files,
`AggregateEmitter`, `oasis-surreal aggregates` subcommand, Roslyn
`IIncrementalGenerator` updates) were superseded by the C#-first pivot
before Phase C code was written. The old approach is preserved in git
history at `137992c` (Phase B shipped) and the pivot rationale at commit
`HEAD-1` (2026-05-27). The `Generated/Flowcharts/` output fulfils the
original goal of showing relationship arrows across the full domain model.

```

**Why this order:**

1. Phase B before C so we ratify the visual layout before paying
   generator-rewrite cost on the wrong shape.
2. Phase C before E so the Quest cutover targets the final generator
   surface, not a moving one.
3. Phase E before F so the new endpoints sit on the post-cutover surface
   (saves ~3h of duplicate rework). **Empirically falsified 2026-06-11**:
   Phase F shipped under autopilot ahead of Phase E with zero measurable
   rework cost — the 14 new endpoints sit on the same hand-written
   `Models.Quest.*` namespace as the pre-existing 16, and will migrate
   together when Phase E lands (one import-site namespace swap per
   store/manager/controller file). Phase E remains real work but is no
   longer a precondition for downstream tracks.
4. dapp-composition integration tests after the Quest cutover so the real
   Surreal-backed Quest pipeline can drive an end-to-end compose →
   generate → deploy test.

## 6. Phased plan (as of snapshot)

| Phase | Work | Effort | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| A. Runbook + tracks consolidation | RUNBOOK.md, tracks.md prune | 1-2h | ✓ Shipped 2026-05-23 (`8f1eee1`) |
| B. Mermaid aggregate slices (visualization-only) | Annotate 24 source `.mermaid` files with `@surreal.slice` + Mermaid relationship lines. Add `oasis-surreal aggregates` subcommand that emits 6 `docs/aggregates/*.mermaid` + `docs/domain.generated.mermaid`. Generator POCO/.surql output unchanged. | 2-3h | ✓ Shipped 2026-05-27 (`137992c`) |
| C. C#-first schema authoring (redesigned again) | Invert the Roslyn source-gen: schema source = decorated C# POCOs (attributes for shape, partial classes for validation). Generator emits `.surql` + `docs/schema.dbml` + state-machine code + guardrail runbook. Mermaid sources retire once byte-equivalent `.surql` is proven on the prototype slice. | TBD — sized after prototype slice | **NEXT (prototype `wallet_nft` slice first)** |
| D. Wave-2 commit + integration | Commit the 3 SurrealQuest stores + tests + `230_quest_graph_edges.*`. | 1h | ✓ Shipped 2026-05-27 (`24a7403`) |
| E. Quest aggregate cutover to generated POCOs | Partial-class extensions + delete hand-written + rewire wave-2 stores + 34 handlers + QuestManager + tests. Aliases vanish. | 7-9h | **READY 2026-06-11** — runtime stable post-quest-api; partial-class swap is now a focused refactor (no longer gating Phases F/G) |
| F. quest-api endpoint gaps | 14 new endpoints + 14 new manager methods (4 spec endpoints reframed onto `QuestRun` per ADR §2.2; see `tracks/quest-api/SIGN-OFF.md`) | 2-3h actual | ✓ Shipped 2026-06-11 (autopilot) |
| G. dapp-composition close-out | Integration tests against the dev-up SurrealDB + Swagger smoke | 1-2h | After F |
| H. Frontend demo harness `frontend-demo-harness` track | shadcn/ui demo harness, 6 phases | 8-10 days | Independent; can start any time |
| I. `durable-saga-orchestration` Tier 1 | Reusable durable-saga + transactional-outbox module | TBD | After surrealdb-migration (done) |
| J. `mcp-surface` Tier 3 | MCP server over SurrealDB graph | — | ✓ Shipped 2026-05-25 (`295d67c`) |
| K. `surrealql-toolkit` strategic program | Umbrella ADR — "Prisma for SurrealQL with first-class graph semantics." Names 5 constituent tracks (data-backfill-migrations, surrealql-drift-detection, surrealql-studio, surrealql-db-pull, surrealql-toolkit-packaging). Wave 0 foundation already shipped via surrealdb-client-package + surrealdb-schema-source-gen + Phase B. | strategic | After Phase C unlocks Wave 1 |

---

## 7. Open questions / pending decisions (as of snapshot)

1. **Aggregate boundary for the slice files** — §4.1 proposes 6 slices.
   Edge case: `dapp_series_quest` references `quest` (different slice). Two
   answers: (a) declare cross-slice relationships in the slice that *owns*
   the FK side, (b) require a master slice for cross-aggregate joins.
   Default to (a) until we hit pain.
2. **Mermaid syntax for cross-aggregate refs** — mermaid `erDiagram` does
   not natively support qualified entity names from other diagrams.
   Workaround: all aggregates emit into the same global namespace; the
   concat step deduplicates entity declarations. Document this in
   CONVENTION.md when Phase B lands.
3. **Concat tooling** — PowerShell vs `dotnet tool` vs MSBuild target.
   PowerShell keeps the dependency surface zero (Windows-native); MSBuild
   target couples it to `dotnet build` so it can't drift. Default to
   MSBuild target (regen on build) since dev-machine touches `.mermaid`
   slices but rarely touches PowerShell.
