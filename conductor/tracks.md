## In flight

_(none — all previously in-flight tracks shipped as of 2026-06-11)_

## Pending

| Track | Status | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| [frontend-demo-harness](tracks/frontend-demo-harness/spec.md) | `[ ]` | shadcn/ui demo harness — full functional test coverage of every OASIS feature. 6 phases, ~8-10 days. Independent of the SurrealDB cutover. See [spec](tracks/frontend-demo-harness/spec.md) + [plan](tracks/frontend-demo-harness/plan.md). |
| [durable-saga-orchestration](tracks/durable-saga-orchestration/spec.md) | `[ ]` | **Tier 1 (architecture)** — reusable hardened durable-saga + transactional-outbox + async-step module; bridge = consumer #1; no broker (homebake); pluggable trigger converges on SurrealDB LIVE queries. Dep: api-safety-hardening ✓, surrealdb-migration ✓. **Both deps now done — track is unblocked.** SagaSteps schema + `ISagaTrigger` / `ISagaStore` foundation already delivered by surrealdb-migration wave-2. |
| [data-backfill-migrations](tracks/data-backfill-migrations/spec.md) | `[ ]` | **Tier 2 — standalone (umbrella framing retired).** First-class data-backfill primitive (`oasis-surreal backfill` CLI + `IBackfill` modules + `data_migration` ledger). F6 FK rewrite is the first real consumer (rewrite FK string columns as `record<table>`). |
| [surrealdb-major-upgrade](tracks/surrealdb-major-upgrade/spec.md) | `[ ]` | **Tier 1 (infrastructure).** Pin is `1.5.4` everywhere; upstream has shipped 2.x and 3.x. Bump server image, `surrealdb.net` SDK, audit SurrealQL surface, revalidate G1 durability gate, sweep docs. 5 phases (DECISION → image → SDK → G1 → docs). Triggered 2026-06-12 by the `surrealkv` feature-flag mismatch in the 1.5.4 image. |

## Shipped

26 tracks complete. One-line summaries — see each spec for detail.

| Track | Summary |
|---|---|
| [dapp-composition](tracks/dapp-composition/spec.md) | **Shipped 2026-06-11 (phase-G).** DappSeries — compose quest chains into deployable dApp contracts via STAR generation. Manager + 2 controllers + 5 validators on source-gen'd POCOs (`DappSeries`/`DappSeriesQuest`). All 10 Acceptance Criteria ticked. 18/18 integration tests green. Closeout also fixed two pre-existing harness bugs (env-name `"Testing"`→`"IntegrationTest"` in test factories; Program.cs Swagger gate broadened to mount in `IntegrationTest` env). |
| [surrealdb-client-package](tracks/surrealdb-client-package/spec.md) | **Shipped 2026-05-24.** Tier 1.5 — homebake `Oasis.SurrealDb.Client` + `.Schema` + `.Analyzer` replacing pre-1.0 `SurrealDb.Net` SDK. Sub-wave 1.5a complete (tag `surrealdb-client-package-1.5a-complete` @ `88f6b26`); 1.5b (WebSocket+LIVE+saga adoption) deferred opportunistically; public publish deferred 3–6mo. Schema SoT pivoted from Mermaid to C#-attributed POCOs on 2026-06-03 — see [surreal-schema-package-retro](tracks/surreal-schema-package-retro/spec.md). |
| [surrealdb-migration](tracks/surrealdb-migration/spec.md) | **Shipped 2026-05-24 (task 9).** Tier 2 — replace EF/Postgres/InMemory with SurrealDB single engine; 7 guardrails (G1–G7) as acceptance. Wave-1 (618/618 unit green): SDK pin, container, integration-test harness rebuild, 7 SCHEMAFULL schemas, query layer, analyzer. Wave-2 quest stores authored. Postgres fallback REMOVED. Tasks 10/11/A10 deferred to post-deploy — see [SIGN-OFF.md](tracks/surrealdb-migration/SIGN-OFF.md). |
| [self-audit-one-fix](tracks/self-audit-one-fix/spec.md) | **Tier 0.5 — pre-launch hygiene. Shipped 2026-06-11.** Closed all 10 audit findings (Buffer→base64Decode in Jupiter; Tinyman decimals + dead-slippage; canonical Algorand msgpack — decision overridden from "remove" to "implement"; settings page chains typing + `getApiUrl()` accessor; native `listNfts()`; `PUT /api/starodk/:id` + typed `updateSTARODK()` — decision overridden from "alias" to dedicated route; `HOLON_COMPOSE` path constant; swap page → typed `getSwapQuote()`/`executeSwap()` + idempotency-key plumbing; `useWallets` → `listWallets()`; AuthWrapper 8-file dead cluster deleted). Also closed a high-sev IDOR on STARODK upsert surfaced by the PUT-route widening (lookup scoped by route id + authenticated avatar; caller-supplied `model.AvatarId` ignored). 36 unit tests cover the IDOR closure; 3 integration tests written but pending separate harness fix (per-test SurrealDB namespace not propagated to WebAPI executor — see follow-up `integration-test-namespace-isolation`). |
| [quest-api](tracks/quest-api/spec.md) | **Phase F (RUNBOOK §5) shipped 2026-06-11.** Quest REST API — 14 new endpoints + 14 new manager methods landed on the post-fork-model runtime (nodes/edges/dependencies sub-resources + `QuestRun` read surface + `MarkRunCompletedAsync`). 30 total endpoints on `QuestController`; 4 obsolete `Quest`-status endpoints (`activate`/`complete`/`fail`/`execution-state`) intentionally reframed onto `QuestRun` per ADR §2.2. Phase E (POCO cutover) now READY but not gating; see [SIGN-OFF.md](tracks/quest-api/SIGN-OFF.md). |
| [surreal-schema-package-retro](tracks/surreal-schema-package-retro/spec.md) | **Tier 1.6 — knowledge capture.** Retro for the C#-first schema pipeline that replaced `surrealdb-schema-source-gen` on 2026-06-03 (Mermaid→POCO deleted; `AttributeSchemaScanner` + `SurqlEmitter` in `Oasis.SurrealDb.Schema` is authoritative). Absorbed into `Persistence/SurrealDb/CONVENTION.md` + RUNBOOK §4/§8 fixes + 6 live doc-comment cleanups + SUPERSEDED banner on the predecessor spec. Shipped 2026-06-11. |
| [core-api](tracks/core-api/spec.md) | Unified provider pattern, base abstractions, `OASISResult` / `OASISResponse` models. |
| [avatar-api](tracks/avatar-api/spec.md) | Avatar controller (register, login, CRUD) — OAuth-like identity + multi-wallet. |
| [holon-api](tracks/holon-api/spec.md) | Holon controller (CRUD, query, cross-provider search, mint, exchange). NFTs as storage-backed holons. |
| [star-api](tracks/star-api/spec.md) | STAR dapp-generator API (scaffold, configure, deploy dapps that operate on holons). |
| [startup-config](tracks/startup-config/spec.md) | `Program.cs` wiring — Swagger, JWT, middleware, manager DI. |
| [tests](tracks/tests/spec.md) | Baseline test suite. Stryker mutation score 59.41%. Suite at 567/567 unit green (2026-06-05 HEAD snapshot; count grows per shipped track). 2026-06-10 audit: 934 .NET tests discoverable across all projects; 146 of them are SkippableFact in IntegrationTests that silently skip when SurrealDB is down. |
| [wallet-api](tracks/wallet-api/spec.md) | First-class Wallet API — CRUD, portfolio analytics, default-wallet management. |
| [nft-api](tracks/nft-api/spec.md) | Semantic NFT layer (mint, transfer, burn, metadata) on Holon infrastructure. |
| [search-api](tracks/search-api/spec.md) | Unified cross-entity search with pagination, filtering, faceted results. |
| [providers-and-cross-chain-bridge](tracks/providers-and-cross-chain-bridge/spec.md) | Algorand + Solana providers via REST/RPC, `BlockchainProviderFactory`, trusted + Wormhole cross-chain bridge. |
| [validation-mapping](tracks/validation-mapping/spec.md) | FluentValidation input pipeline + AutoMapper entity-DTO mapping layer. |
| [oasis-wallet-sdk](tracks/oasis-wallet-sdk_20260509/spec.md) | Cross-platform Node SDK (`@oasis/wallet-sdk`) — client-side tx signing, OASIS API client, DEX adapters. 76+ tests. |

Multi-agent review APPROVE. Pre-launch gates in [RESIDUAL-RISK-RUNBOOK §4](tracks/api-safety-hardening/RESIDUAL-RISK-RUNBOOK.md) (`IVaaSignatureVerifier` — Wormhole value flow fail-closed until done). |
| [architecture-decoupling](tracks/architecture-decoupling/spec.md) | **Tier 1** — per-aggregate `I*Store` seam, `IQuestNodeHandler` 34-handler registry (QuestManager ctor 9→3, 315-line switch gone), bounded `IMemoryCache`, OpenTelemetry + live `/health`. APPROVE-WITH-SIMPLIFICATIONS. Precondition for SurrealDB satisfied. |
| [quest-temporal-fork-model](tracks/quest-temporal-fork-model/spec.md) | **Tier 1** — definition/runtime split: `QuestRun` + `QuestNodeExecution` separated from `Quest`/`QuestNode`; `ForkAsync(runId, atNodeId, reason)` produces lineage-tracked fork. Hand-off [`SURREAL-SCHEMA-HINTS.md`](tracks/quest-temporal-fork-model/SURREAL-SCHEMA-HINTS.md) consumed by surrealdb-migration tasks 3/9/10. 7 fork/lineage tests green. |
| [surrealdb-schema-source-gen](tracks/surrealdb-schema-source-gen/spec.md) | **Tier 1.6 — SUPERSEDED 2026-06-03.** Mermaid→POCO pipeline deleted; replaced by C#-first attribute scanner (`AttributeSchemaScanner` + `SurqlEmitter` in `Oasis.SurrealDb.Schema`). 26 POCOs now in `Persistence/SurrealDb/Models/` with `[SurrealTable]` attributes; `AttributePocoByteEquivalenceTests` is the new acceptance gate. `Oasis.SurrealDb.SourceGen` package + test shell removed 2026-06-10. See [surreal-schema-package-retro](tracks/surreal-schema-package-retro/spec.md) for the full as-built reference. |
| [mcp-surface](tracks/mcp-surface/spec.md) | **Tier 3** — read-only MCP surface (5 tools + auth scoping + HNSW vector search) at `/mcp` via ModelContextProtocol.AspNetCore. Closed 2026-05-25 (`295d67c`); write tools deferred. |

## Historical status snapshots (moved from RUNBOOK 2026-06-12)

RUNBOOK.md was restructured into a true operations runbook on 2026-06-12.
Its prior status-snapshot, shipped-retro, forward-sequencing, phased-plan,
and open-questions content (a point-in-time record, not live track status)
was relocated verbatim to
[retros/runbook-status-2026-06-12.md](retros/runbook-status-2026-06-12.md).
This catalog above remains the authoritative source for live track status.
