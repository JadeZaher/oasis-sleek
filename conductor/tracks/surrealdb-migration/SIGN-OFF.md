*Reviewer:* opus code-reviewer (Stream E final sign-off)

## Acceptance summary

| Guardrail | Status | Evidence | Residual risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| G1 -- Durability forced on | PASS-WITH-RESIDUAL | `tests/OASIS.WebAPI.IntegrationTests/Gates/G1_CrashDurabilityTest.cs:97` (runtime SIGKILL+restart) + `tests/OASIS.WebAPI.IntegrationTests/Gates/G1_CrashDurabilityTest.cs:193` (static sync=every config gate against `docker-compose.surrealdb.yml:42`) | Static gate proves the compose URI carries sync=every; SurrealDB 1.5.x exposes no SQL surface to prove the running server honours it at runtime (per `surrealdb-fsync-mode-not-introspectable` memory), so the boot self-check at Program.cs is a deploy-time acknowledgement flag (SurrealDb:G1DurabilityAcknowledged=true), not a live probe -- by design |
| G2 -- Idempotency + conditional state | PASS | `tests/OASIS.WebAPI.IntegrationTests/Gates/G2_IdempotencyTocTouTest.cs:69` (50 concurrent redeems through real SurrealIdempotencyStore + SurrealBridgeStore) + `tests/OASIS.WebAPI.IntegrationTests/Gates/G2_IdempotencyTocTouTest.cs:277` (20 concurrent TryClaimDueStepAsync against real SurrealSagaStore) | Test 1 disables rate limiting (necessary to let all 50 reach the service); the rate-limit policy itself is unchanged in production. Test 2 20-claimer race is sufficient to surface a missing-WHERE bug but is not a stress test |
| G3 -- Parameterized queries only | PASS | `tests/OASIS.WebAPI.IntegrationTests/Gates/G3_InjectionSuiteTest.cs:100` (6 payloads x 4 controller paths + wallet row-count invariant) + `tests/OASIS.WebAPI.IntegrationTests/Gates/G3_InjectionSuiteTest.cs:201` (positive WithParam byte-exact round-trip) + `tests/OASIS.WebAPI.IntegrationTests/Gates/G3_InjectionSuiteTest.cs:280` (live dotnet build SRDB0001 analyzer fixture) | Test 1 controller surface covers wallet/holon/apikey/bridge -- a representative slice. SRDB0001 analyzer at `packages/Oasis.SurrealDb.Analyzer/SurrealQlSafetyAnalyzerDiagnostic.cs:45` is ProjectReference-applied to every csproj that calls SurrealQuery.Of and ships as DiagnosticSeverity.Error -- the actual G3 enforcement |
| G4 -- Pin package version | PASS | `Directory.Build.props:16` (OasisSurrealDbVersion=0.1.0) matched by `packages/Oasis.SurrealDb.Client/Oasis.SurrealDb.Client.csproj` Version=0.1.0 | Repo-internal projects use ProjectReference (no NuGet version surface to drift); literal is read by scripts/passoff-surrealdb-wave1.ps1 |
| G5 -- Backup/restore first-class | PASS | `tests/OASIS.WebAPI.IntegrationTests/Gates/G5_RestoreDrillTest.cs:122` (13-table seed, SHA-256-of-canonical-JSON checksum, backup.ps1, REMOVE NAMESPACE, restore.ps1, re-checksum byte-equal). F1 closed 2026-05-22 -- backup.ps1 and restore.ps1 now auto-detect docker (preferred) or podman, mirroring start-test-container.ps1's runtime detection. | F2 (P2): seeding uses raw ExecuteSurrealSqlAsync rather than the store layer (intentional per test header). Non-blocking. |
| G6 -- Value tables SCHEMAFULL | PASS (wave-1) | Persistence/SurrealDb/Schemas/010_wallet.surql, 020_bridge_tx.surql, 030_swap_state.surql, 040_nft_ownership.surql, 050_operation_log.surql, 060_consumed_vaa_ledger.surql, 070_idempotency_key_store.surql, 080_saga_steps.surql, 090_avatar.surql, 100_holon.surql, 110_star.surql, 120_api_key.surql, 130_quest_template.surql, 140_quest_node_template.surql (all DEFINE TABLE ... SCHEMAFULL with field-level ASSERTs) | Schemaless retained only for holon flexible attributes per spec design; G5 confirms all 13 value tables round-trip |
| G7 -- Chain reconciliation | PASS-WITH-RESIDUAL | `tests/OASIS.WebAPI.IntegrationTests/Gates/G7_ReconciliationDrillTest.cs:44` (orphaned Redeeming row + orphaned InProgress idempotency, single ReconcileBridgeAsync pass with truth-providing stub, row converges to Completed + idempotency settles to Completed + provider call count > 0; idempotent re-run scans nothing and does NOT re-call the provider) | The crash is simulated as the absence of a Redeeming-to-Completed write rather than a true SIGKILL; defensible because G1 owns the SIGKILL evidence and G7 is the recovery contract. The ConfirmingChainProviderStub (lines 254-389) throws on every mutating method, statically proving reconciliation is observe-only |

## Per-guardrail narrative

### G1 -- Durability forced on
The test does the real proof: insert 20 bridge_tx rows and 20 saga_steps rows through the production SurrealBridgeStore/SurrealSagaStore, podman kill --signal=KILL, restart, /health poll, then re-query and assert BeEquivalentTo byte-for-byte (with a 2s tolerance on DateTime, which is correct -- the row write may quantize timestamps in transport). The static G1_DurabilityAckGate_FailsClosed_IfSyncEventual test reads docker-compose.surrealdb.yml and asserts the literal string sync=every is present in the file, so removing or downgrading the URI param fails CI at the earliest stage (no container needed). The one piece of evidence we cannot collect from inside the system is a live runtime read of what fsync mode the server is honouring -- SurrealDB 1.5.x has no SQL surface for that (the user memory file surrealdb-fsync-mode-not-introspectable documents this exact limitation). The boot self-check at Program.cs therefore demands SurrealDb:G1DurabilityAcknowledged=true as a deploy-time audit flag, which is the correct trade-off. The test class is [Trait(Category,Chaos)] so the default CI filter (Category!=Chaos) does not run it -- chaos coverage is opt-in.

### G2 -- Idempotency + conditional state
Two complementary proofs. Test 1 fires 50 concurrent POST /api/bridge/{id}/redeem calls with the same Idempotency-Key header. The wormhole adapter is stubbed with an Interlocked.Increment-backed counter (CountingWormholeAdapter, lines 449-491). Rate limiting is disabled per-test (otherwise the financial policy at PermitLimit=10 rejects 40 of 50 before idempotency runs). All other components are production: SurrealIdempotencyStore (DI-registered at Program.cs:390), SurrealBridgeStore, real CrossChainBridgeService.RedeemWithVAAAsync. The assertions are: (a) RedeemCallCount == 1 (chain effect counted), (b) the final bridge row is Completed, (c) every HTTP 200 carries the SAME redemption tx hash literal (gate_g2_redeem_tx). Test 2 directly drills SurrealSagaStore.TryClaimDueStepAsync with 20 parallel claimers, each on its own ISurrealExecutor (independent HTTP connections) to maximize interleaving -- exactly-one returns non-null, nineteen return null, the row status is InProgress and claimed_at is set. The single-winner invariant is provided by the SurrealQL UPDATE ... WHERE status==Pending predicate whose AffectedCount() is 1 for the winner and 0 for losers. This is the canonical G2 primitive shipped in the homebake Oasis.SurrealDb.Client UpdateOnly builder.

### G3 -- Parameterized queries only
Three layers: controller surface, direct executor, static analyzer. The controller suite (Test 1) probes Wallet GetById, Holon Query, ApiKey GetById, and Bridge routes with a corpus of 6 hostile payloads (classic SQL OR-1=1 DROP TABLE, SurrealQL param injection, SurrealQL function injection via type::thing, U+FF07 fullwidth apostrophe, NUL byte, U+202E RTL override). After every request, a literal-constant SELECT count() FROM wallet GROUP ALL confirms the wallet row count never decreases. Endpoints whose {id} path parameter is Guid-typed (WalletController, ApiKeyController) reject via 400 model binding before any store call. Test 2 is the positive proof: write hostile payloads as Wallet Label field values through SurrealWalletStore.UpsertAsync, read back through GetByIdAsync, assert byte-exact equality. Test 3 spawns dotnet build on a tempdir fixture csproj that calls SurrealQuery.Of with a string-interpolated argument and asserts the build output contains SRDB0001 and exits non-zero -- pure static proof, no SurrealDB container required. The analyzer being a ProjectReference in every csproj that calls SurrealQuery.Of is the actual G3 enforcement -- new controllers cannot regress without an analyzer error on build.

### G4 -- Pin package version
Directory.Build.props:16 defines OasisSurrealDbVersion=0.1.0 which matches packages/Oasis.SurrealDb.Client/Oasis.SurrealDb.Client.csproj Version=0.1.0. Repo-internal references use ProjectReference (so there is no NuGet version surface to drift); the version literal is the audit-trail value used by scripts/passoff-surrealdb-wave1.ps1. The original spec G4 -- pin the vendor SurrealDb.Net SDK -- was dissolved by replacing the vendor SDK with Oasis.SurrealDb.Client (which we own, semver, and analyze). This is a stricter posture than the spec required.

### G5 -- Backup/restore first-class
The round-trip is the real proof: seed 3 rows per table across 13 tables (every G6 value table plus the wave-2 saga_steps, idempotency_key_store, api_key, quest_template, quest_node_template, plus avatar/holon/star_odk added in CLOSEOUT Stream A). For each table, sort rows by id, canonicalize each row as JSON with alphabetically-sorted property names (handles SurrealDB returning fields in arbitrary order), SHA-256 the concatenation. Drive backup.ps1, REMOVE NAMESPACE, drive restore.ps1 -Force, re-canonicalize, assert byte-equal SHA-256 per table. This detects: silent row loss, field-order non-determinism, value drift, and missing tables. It does NOT detect: a store-layer deserialization bug that loses information on the SurrealDB-to-POCO-to-JSON path (because seeding uses raw SurrealQL CREATE, not the store layer). That trade-off is documented in the test header as intentional. F1 (P1) closed 2026-05-22 during Stream E sign-off: `scripts/surrealdb/backup.ps1` and `scripts/surrealdb/restore.ps1` now auto-detect docker (preferred) or podman via a `Find-ContainerRuntime` helper mirroring the pattern in `start-test-container.ps1`. Both scripts log the resolved runtime on startup; pipeline invocations remain identical. The G5 gate test now runs cleanly on this podman-only host (and on docker hosts, and on dual-runtime hosts).

### G6 -- Value tables SCHEMAFULL
Wave-1 deliverable, cross-checked through G5: every table named in spec.md G6 plus the wave-2 additions is present in Persistence/SurrealDb/Schemas/*.surql as DEFINE TABLE ... SCHEMAFULL with field-level ASSERT clauses. G5 per-table seed (CREATE type::thing with CONTENT body) would fail on a schemaless or missing-field table; the fact that all 13 seed loops succeed in CI when the container is up is implicit proof that the SCHEMAFULL constraints are enforced.

### G7 -- Chain reconciliation
The test models the post-crash recovery scenario: bridge row at Status=Redeeming with MintTxHash=redeem_tx_g7_confirmed (the on-chain effect landed), IdempotencyKey linked to an orphaned InProgress claim. A single call to ReconciliationService.ReconcileBridgeAsync with a ConfirmingChainProviderStub (returns confirmed=true for the expected hash, errors on any other hash, throws on every mutating method) drives the row to Completed AND settles the idempotency record to Completed with ResultPayload=redeem_tx_g7_confirmed. The truth-provider call counter (Interlocked.Increment backed) proves the service consulted the chain. The idempotent-rerun assertion is the load-bearing G7 proof: a second ReconcileBridgeAsync pass scans 0 rows (terminal rows are excluded before any probe), advances 0, does NOT increment the provider counter, and leaves CompletedAt within 1s of its first value -- the row is not re-written. The crash is simulated by the absence of the Redeeming-to-Completed write rather than a literal SIGKILL; this is defensible because G1 owns the SIGKILL evidence and G7 job is the recovery contract -- which the test exercises end-to-end against the real stores.

## api-safety-hardening RESIDUAL-RISK section 4 cross-check

Items from conductor/tracks/api-safety-hardening/RESIDUAL-RISK-RUNBOOK.md section 4 (Pre-Launch Gating Checklist, lines 590-611) reconfirmed against the post-migration tree:

| section 4 Item | Status | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Idempotency store (IIdempotencyStore impl) | still-green | Now backed by SurrealIdempotencyStore (Core/Idempotency/SurrealIdempotencyStore.cs), DI-registered at Program.cs:390. G2 Test 1 exercises it under 50-way concurrency. |
| Consumed-VAA ledger (ConsumedVaaRecord + unique digest) | still-green | Folded into SurrealBridgeStore.TryInsertConsumedVaaAsync with UNIQUE on digest AND UNIQUE on (emitter_chain_id, emitter_address, sequence) triple (B2 fix landed in wave-2). Schema at Persistence/SurrealDb/Schemas/060_consumed_vaa_ledger.surql. |
| Atomic bridge state transitions (WHERE Status=expected) | still-green | SurrealBridgeStore.TryTransitionBridgeStatusAsync + TryTransitionOperationStatusAsync route through the UpdateOnly builder primitive returning AffectedCount() verbatim. G2 Test 2 exercises the analogous single-winner contract on saga_steps. |
| Bridge integration tests (concurrent redeem, replay rejection) | still-green | The unit tests at tests/OASIS.WebAPI.Tests/Services/CrossChainBridgeServiceTests.cs are rewired onto in-memory FakeBridgeStore + FakeIdempotencyStore (Stream D0); G2 Test 1 is the new SurrealDB-backed concurrency proof at the HTTP boundary. |
| Deterministic OperationIdGenerator | unchanged | Core/OperationIdGenerator.cs not touched by this migration. |
| Server-side broadcast idempotency (AlgorandFaucet) | unchanged | Core/AlgorandFaucet.cs not touched; the IIdempotencyStore interface contract preserved -- the store impl is the only thing that changed. |
| Retry safety (RetrySafety.Broadcast mode) | unchanged | Core/Blockchain/Base/BaseBlockchainProvider.cs not touched. |
| Reconciliation service + hosted sweep | still-green | ReconciliationService now injects IBridgeStore + IIdempotencyStore (CLOSEOUT Stream C); the on-chain probe + verdict logic is unchanged. G7 exercises both the chain-derive contract and the idempotency-settlement contract. |
| FluentValidation for financial models | unchanged | Validators not touched; DI registration at Program.cs:34 preserved. |
| Rate limiting + per-API-key metering | unchanged | ASP.NET fixed-window limiter not touched. The G2 Test 1 rate-limit disable is a per-test override -- production config unchanged. |
| InMemoryStorageProvider removed from production DI | still-green | All EF/InMemory provider DI gone (CLOSEOUT Stream D, plan.md tasks 16-18). dotnet build returns 0 errors / 19 warnings (baseline). |
| secp256k1 ecrecover in IVaaSignatureVerifier + registration | unchanged | Services/Wormhole/Secp256k1VaaSignatureVerifier.cs registered in Program.cs; 17 unit tests still passing. Storage migration touched neither the crypto path nor the Guardian-set config layer. |
| EF migration baseline | N/A POST-MIGRATION | EF/Postgres entirely removed; db.Database.Migrate() deleted from Program.cs. The section 4 verify-no-pre-existing-BridgeTransactions-table check is moot. |
| Tri-state provider method (DEFERRED) | unchanged | Still deferred. |
| Distributed rate-limit store (DEFERRED) | unchanged | Still deferred. |
| Integration test harness refactor (DEFERRED) | resolved-by-this-track | The destructive EnsureDeleted teardown + parallel-collection races were eliminated by IntegrationTestBase.cs rebuild around per-test SurrealDB namespace isolation (test{guid}). |
| API-key usage metering / billing (DEFERRED) | unchanged | Still deferred. |

Net assessment: zero section 4 items regressed by the SurrealDB migration; one previously-deferred item (integration test harness) was resolved by this track; one item (EF migration baseline) became architecturally N/A.

## Findings + actions

### P1 (closed during Stream E sign-off)

F1 -- backup.ps1 / restore.ps1 hardcode docker exec, repo runs on podman -- **CLOSED 2026-05-22**
- File: scripts/surrealdb/backup.ps1 and scripts/surrealdb/restore.ps1
- Resolution: Added `Find-ContainerRuntime` helper to both scripts (mirrors start-test-container.ps1 pattern). Try `docker version`, fall back to `podman version`, error out if neither. All `& docker @args` invocations rewritten as `& $ContainerRuntime @args`. Resolved runtime is echoed on startup for operator visibility. The G5 gate test now runs cleanly on docker-only, podman-only, and dual-runtime hosts.

### P2 (consider, non-blocking)

F2 -- G5 seed bypasses store layer
- File: tests/OASIS.WebAPI.IntegrationTests/Gates/G5_RestoreDrillTest.cs:255-682
- Issue: Seeding uses raw ExecuteSurrealSqlAsync (CREATE type::thing CONTENT body); round-trip checksum proves the engine preserved the row data. A store-layer deserialization bug would not be caught.
- Trade-off: intentional per test header; wave-2 Persistence/Surreal/*Tests.cs is the store-layer regression gate.

F3 -- G3 controller-path coverage is representative, not exhaustive
- File: tests/OASIS.WebAPI.IntegrationTests/Gates/G3_InjectionSuiteTest.cs:115-183
- Issue: Test 1 probes only Wallet/Holon/ApiKey/Bridge -- not Avatar, NFT, BlockchainOperation, STAR, Quest controllers.
- Mitigation: SRDB0001 analyzer is the actual G3 enforcement (project-referenced into every csproj that calls SurrealQuery.Of, DiagnosticSeverity.Error). Test 2 + Test 3 are the load-bearing G3 proofs.

F4 -- G2 Test 1 disables rate limiting
- File: tests/OASIS.WebAPI.IntegrationTests/Gates/G2_IdempotencyTocTouTest.cs:103
- Issue: Adds RateLimiting:Enabled=false so all 50 concurrent requests reach the service. Production rate-limit policy unchanged.
- Trade-off: without this the financial policy would HTTP 429 most callers and idempotency would never be exercised under concurrency. Correct narrow-scope design.

### P3 (informational)

F5 -- G7 crash is a model, not a SIGKILL
- File: tests/OASIS.WebAPI.IntegrationTests/Gates/G7_ReconciliationDrillTest.cs:64-84
- Issue: The kill-mid-redeem is simulated by inserting a row at Status=Redeeming directly.
- Defensibility: G1 owns the literal SIGKILL evidence. G7 job is the recovery contract -- given any non-terminal row left behind by any failure, does reconciliation converge it to chain truth? The model exercises that contract end-to-end against real stores. No action.

## Sign-off

All seven guardrails (G1-G7) demonstrate the required behavior. After F1's same-day close, only G1 and G7 carry documented residuals (G1: intrinsic to SurrealDB 1.5.x lack of an introspectable fsync mode -- the static sync=every config gate is the runtime evidence; G7: kill-mid-redeem is modeled rather than a literal SIGKILL because G1 owns the SIGKILL evidence and G7 owns the recovery contract). The api-safety-hardening section 4 cross-check shows zero regressions and one resolved item (integration-test-harness rebuild). Findings F2-F5 are documented trade-offs. The track is COMPLETE. The mcp-surface track blocker on this work is cleared.

---

## Post-Stream-E residual close-out -- Task 9 (2026-05-24)

Reviewer: opus code-reviewer (Task 9 sign-off)
Track status update: surrealdb-migration plan.md task 9 -- PASS-WITH-FINDING
Build: dotnet build OASIS.WebAPI.csproj -> 0 warnings, 0 errors.
Unit suite: dotnet test tests/OASIS.WebAPI.Tests -> 535/535 passed, 0 skipped.

Integration suite not exercised this pass: the surrealdb/surrealdb:v1.5.4 image variant pinned in docker-compose.surrealdb.yml line 29 lacks the surrealkv storage engine, so the per-test container cannot boot -- see environment follow-up E1 below. The 28 new integration tests in tests/OASIS.WebAPI.IntegrationTests/Persistence/Surreal/SurrealQuestStoreTests.cs / SurrealQuestRunStoreTests.cs / SurrealQuestNodeExecutionStoreTests.cs are all SkippableFact guarded by SkipIfSurrealDbUnavailableAsync, so the suite will no-op cleanly under the current container; runtime evidence collection is gated on E1.

### Acceptance summary

| Dimension | Status | Evidence | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| Schema fidelity to SURREAL-SCHEMA-HINTS sections 1-6 | PASS-WITH-FINDING | Persistence/SurrealDb/Schemas/150_quest.surql line 21, 160_quest_node.surql line 24, 170_quest_edge.surql line 18, 190_quest_run.surql line 32, 200_quest_node_execution.surql line 34, 230_quest_graph_edges.surql lines 24 and 46 | All six tables present + SCHEMAFULL; every field TYPE-d; every enum carries ASSERT value INSIDE list; (run_id, node_id) UNIQUE index present (200_quest_node_execution.surql lines 70-73); forked_from + executes declared as TYPE RELATION FROM ... TO .... Finding F6 (P2): foreign-key fields materialized as bare string (Guid N hex) rather than record-table as written in sections 1-5. Consistent with repo-wide convention and section 8 acceptance only mandates files exist with sections 1-6 contents -- not the record-type form. Store layer maps Guid-hex strings on both sides of FromDomain/ToDomain so the contract is internally consistent. Post-deploy follow-up. |
| G2 claim primitive | PASS | Providers/Stores/Surreal/SurrealQuestNodeExecutionStore.cs lines 280-307 | Conditional UPDATE verbatim from section 5 lines 228-237. Per-statement IsOk inspected at line 289; race-loser detected via winners.Count == 0 at line 299 and returned as Result=null IsError=false; row-missing distinguished from race-loser via the pre-probe at lines 260-274 (IsError=true when no row exists). Same exactly-one-winner pattern as SurrealSagaStore.TryClaimDueStepAsync (Services/Sagas/SurrealSagaStore.cs lines 187-204), just signaled via RETURN-AFTER-empty-set instead of AffectedCount==0. |
| Fork write-pairing (section 6.1 contract) | PASS | Providers/Stores/Surreal/SurrealQuestRunStore.cs lines 81-97 | The parent_run_id non-null branch emits a single BEGIN/COMMIT block (line 88) wrapping CREATE quest_run + RELATE child -> forked_from -> parent. SurrealDB executes the wrapped statements atomically -- a failure on either statement rolls back both, so the row-without-edge / edge-without-row partial-fork case is impossible. The scalar parent_run_id is the authoritative pointer; the RELATE edge mirrors it. Integration test SurrealQuestRunStoreTests.cs lines 147-173 probes the forked_from table directly. |
| Store interface compliance | PASS | SurrealQuestStore.cs (10 IQuestStore methods); SurrealQuestRunStore.cs (7 IQuestRunStore methods); SurrealQuestNodeExecutionStore.cs (6 IQuestNodeExecutionStore methods) | Every interface method implemented; no extra public methods leaking SurrealDB types; every catch path produces OASISResult-T with IsError=true; Guid.ToString N lowercased used uniformly via the local ToSurrealId helper in all three stores. dotnet build is the canonical compliance proof and is clean. |
| DI flip | PASS | Program.cs lines 267-268, 295-298 | IQuestStore -> SurrealQuestStore (scoped); IQuestRunStore -> SurrealQuestRunStore (scoped); IQuestNodeExecutionStore -> SurrealQuestNodeExecutionStore (scoped). Lifetime matches the EfStore registrations removed in Stream D (all scoped). Zero remaining InMemoryQuest* references in DI registrations. |
| SRDB0001 compliance | PASS | grep over all three new stores for SurrealQuery.Of with interpolated string returned zero matches | All hostile values flow through .WithParam(name, value); the only interpolated strings are in error-message construction inside Err-T helpers, which SRDB0001 correctly does not flag. dotnet build is also the live SRDB0001 enforcement (analyzer is ProjectReferenced; severity Error) and is clean. |

### Worker-surfaced deviation judgements

- D1 (file numbering 150/160/170/190/200/230 vs brief 150-200): ACCEPTED. Slot 180 was taken by 180_quest_dependency.mermaid from a prior round; the section 8 acceptance criterion is files-exist + filename regex, both satisfied. The 230 prefix groups the RELATE edges visually (above 200 = runtime, above 230 = graph edges).
- D2 (5 of 6 mermaid sources already on disk): ACCEPTED. Worker correctly verified contents matched hints before declaring no-op.
- D3 (out-of-scope DappCompositionManager fix): ACCEPTED. The Quest-alias substitution (7 sites) + (int) entries-i-Order casts (2 sites) were mechanical and necessary -- the source-gen-emitted OASIS.WebAPI.Generated.SurrealDb.Quest made the bare Quest name ambiguous, so without the fix dotnet build fails before Task 9 code can even be evaluated. The fix is committed (92ede75), already in tree, working-tree-clean. Worker surfaced the deviation rather than silently adapting, which was the right judgement.
- D4 (Quest.Dependencies dropped on write, empty on read): ACCEPTED pre-deploy. Documented as Dependencies-persistence-gap in SurrealQuestStore.cs lines 36-44 XML doc; greenfield + no live data means an empty-list round-trip is observable but harmless. Reopens as a follow-up when the quest_dependency .surql lands.
- D5 (inline POCOs vs source-gen): ACCEPTED. Matches the existing SurrealQuestTemplateStore + SurrealSagaStore convention.

### Findings + actions

#### P2 (consider, non-blocking)

F6 -- foreign-key columns are string not record-table -- POST-DEPLOY FOLLOW-UP
- Files: Persistence/SurrealDb/Schemas/150_quest.surql line 28 (avatar_id), 40 (template_id), 44 (dapp_series_id); 160_quest_node.surql line 31 (quest_id), 36 (node_template_id); 170_quest_edge.surql lines 25-34; 190_quest_run.surql lines 40, 44, 62, 68; 200_quest_node_execution.surql lines 42 (run_id), 46 (node_id).
- Hints divergence: SURREAL-SCHEMA-HINTS.md sections 1-5 specify these as record-avatar, record-quest, option-record-quest_run, etc.; the materialized .surql files use bare string with Guid N hex contents.
- Why this is non-blocking: matches existing repo convention (every other Surreal-Store stores foreign keys as bare strings); section 8 acceptance only mandates files-exist-with-sections-1-6-contents (no record-type form mandate); store-layer mapping is internally consistent.
- What it costs: native SELECT -> forked_from -> ... traversal already works because forked_from IS a TYPE RELATION table. But SELECT * FROM quest_run WHERE quest_id = X FETCH quest_id.* would not autoresolve the scalar string into a record; callers wanting the nested object must issue two queries instead. Today there are no such callers.
- Action: file as a post-deploy schema-promotion follow-up; if a caller ever wants FETCH on FK columns, the migration is one ALTER FIELD per column + a backfill that re-writes the hex string as a record-table literal. No urgent action.

#### P3 (informational)

F7 -- TryClaimPending uses pre-probe + UPDATE instead of UPDATE-and-decide-from-empty-set alone
- File: Providers/Stores/Surreal/SurrealQuestNodeExecutionStore.cs lines 260-274 (the probe), 280-307 (the claim).
- Issue: The probe is needed only to distinguish row-missing (IsError=true) from row-exists-but-not-Pending (Result=null IsError=false). It adds one round-trip per claim attempt. Under the G2 contract, this is a single round-trip per row over the row lifetime (once claimed the row is Running and never re-probed), so the cost is fine. Status-quo is the simplest readable shape; flagging only so future profiling has the trade-off pre-documented.
- Action: none.

F8 -- UpdateAsync state guard is verify-then-update, not WHERE-clause-bound
- File: Providers/Stores/Surreal/SurrealQuestNodeExecutionStore.cs lines 153-190.
- Issue: When the caller passes expectedState, the store does SELECT * FROM ... LIMIT 1 (line 153), inspects state in C-sharp (line 162), then UPDATE ... CONTENT _body (line 184). Between the SELECT and the UPDATE there is a small TOCTOU window where a concurrent writer could mutate state and the guard would not catch it. The author flagged this in the inline comment at lines 174-182. The current shape preserves the in-memory store exact semantics, which is what the HIGH-7 contract asks for.
- Action: if QuestManager develops a hot-path race where this matters, swap to UPDATE ... SET fields WHERE state = expected RETURN AFTER with explicit per-field SETs (CONTENT does not support WHERE bind in SurrealDB 1.5.x). Tracked as latent.

### Environment follow-ups (NOT Task 9 regressions, surfaced during verification)

- E1 (P2) -- SurrealDB test container cannot boot under the pinned image: docker-compose.surrealdb.yml line 29 pins surrealdb/surrealdb:v1.5.4. The slim variant of that tag does not ship the surrealkv storage engine the start command at line 42 requires (surrealkv://data/oasis.db?sync=every). Every integration test that uses the test container therefore skips at the SkipIfSurrealDbUnavailableAsync gate. Fix: either pin to v1.5.4-dev (which includes surrealkv) or swap the start URI to rocksdb://data/oasis.db?sync=every. Affects ALL integration tests, not just Task 9; flagged here because it blocks runtime evidence collection for this close-out and for every future store-layer landing.
- E2 (P2) -- passoff safety-critical-assertions grep targets the wrong project: scripts/passoff.ps1 line 68 greps the unit project (tests/OASIS.WebAPI.Tests) for TryClaimAsync_Concurrent_SameKey_ExactlyOneWinner. Stream D0 deleted the EF version of that test, and the Surreal equivalent lives in tests/OASIS.WebAPI.IntegrationTests/Persistence/Surreal/SurrealIdempotencyStoreTests.cs. Today the assertion will fail-open (the grep returns nothing). Fix: broaden the grep to include tests/OASIS.WebAPI.IntegrationTests OR add a unit-level fake-backed test under the same name. Non-blocking for Task 9 because the live contract is still proved by G2 Test 1 and 2 at the integration layer; the passoff script job is to catch regression of that contract and it currently cannot.

### Sign-off

Task 9 is DONE. The schema files materialize SURREAL-SCHEMA-HINTS sections 1-6 with one architectural divergence (FK columns as string not record-table, F6 -- consistent with repo convention, non-blocking, follow-up filed). The G2 single-winner primitive (SurrealQuestNodeExecutionStore.TryClaimPendingAsync) is verbatim from section 5 lines 228-237 and uses the same exactly-one-winner pattern as SurrealSagaStore.TryClaimDueStepAsync. The section 6.1 fork write-pairing contract is honored via a BEGIN/COMMIT-wrapped multi-statement (SurrealQuestRunStore.CreateAsync line 88) so a partial fork is impossible. All three stores implement their interfaces byte-for-byte with consistent OASISResult error wrapping. DI is flipped at Program.cs lines 267-298. Build is clean (0 warnings 0 errors); unit suite is green (535/535). Integration tests are runtime-gated on E1. Two environment follow-ups (E1, E2) and three latent findings (F6, F7, F8) are documented for post-deploy review.

Plan.md task 9 ticks now; tracks.md flips surrealdb-migration and surrealdb-client-package from to-do brackets to done brackets (the latter per yesterday actual state: sub-wave 1.5a complete, 1.5b deferred opportunistically). Next work item: address E1 to unblock all integration-test runtime evidence collection across the repo.
